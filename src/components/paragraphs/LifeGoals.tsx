            Lazy Magic Games is dedicated to bringing a uniqure and
            fun experience to every game we product! Our later piece
            of work is non-other than{' '}
            <strong>Project Titan: Strategy Card Game.</strong> Though
            PTSCG is a card game dedicated to combat, we at LMG have a
            litany of games being worked on for the consumer. All of
            which are unique and provide a new experience with each
            playthrough.

            As creators we find ourselves wanting to help the
            customer, in any way we can, to understand rules, artwork,
            or why we do what we do. That being said we provide many
            video instructions on all of our games. As well as open
            lines of communication to discuss, amongst the community,
            what issues they have or rules in question.

          <p>
            I grew up playing games with my father who was ultimately
            the reason why I started to develop games on my own. My
            father was a man of great imagination and whimsicalness.
            It was he who instilled in me the foundation I use in all
            our games. That being, &quot;Chase everything{' '}
            <strong>you</strong> are passionate about because no one
            else will.&quot;
